# kivy_project_template

A simple template for a Kivy python based GUI


This is a basic template for a Kivy project.

The difference between this template and many of the samples given in different websites is that:

    - multi folder arrangement of .kv files
    - multi folder arrangement of different screens of the project.
    - using navigation panel
    - using multi-tabbed panel.


To install the requirements (preferably in a virtual environment).

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

Run the project:

```python
python main.py
```

The code was tested on python3.8
